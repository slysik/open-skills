This skill enables your coding agent to leverage Cortex Code's specialized Snowflake expertise by intelligently routing Snowflake-related operations to Cortex Code CLI in headless mode.

## Architecture Overview

**Routing Principle**: ONLY Snowflake operations → Cortex Code. Everything else → your coding agent.

**Key Components**:
- Dynamic skill discovery at session initialization
- LLM-based semantic routing (not keyword matching)
- Security wrapper with approval modes (prompt/auto/envelope_only)
- Stateless Cortex execution with context enrichment
- Hybrid memory management
- Audit logging for compliance

## Security

The skill includes a security wrapper around Cortex execution with three approval modes:

### Approval Modes

1. **prompt** (default): High security
   - User shown approval prompt with predicted tools and confidence
   - User must approve before execution
   - No audit logging required
   - Best for: Interactive sessions, untrusted prompts, production

2. **auto**: Medium security
   - All operations auto-approved
   - Mandatory audit logging
   - Envelopes still enforced
   - Best for: Automated workflows, trusted environments

3. **envelope_only**: Medium security
   - No tool prediction (faster)
   - Auto-approved with audit logging
   - Relies on envelope blocklist only
   - Best for: Trusted environments, low latency needs

**Configuration**: Set in `config.yaml` in the skill's install directory, or via organization policy.

> **IMPORTANT — `config.yaml` is optional.** The skill ships only `config.yaml.example` as a template. If no `config.yaml` exists, the Python scripts apply safe defaults (`approval_mode: prompt`, `default_envelope: RO`). **Do not search, glob, or `ls` for `config.yaml` before executing** — `ConfigManager` handles this internally. Only read/create `config.yaml` if the user explicitly asks to change settings.

### Built-in Protections

- **Prompt Sanitization**: Automatic PII removal and injection detection
- **Credential Blocking**: Prevents routing when credential paths detected
- **Secure Caching**: SHA256-validated cache in `~/.cache/cortex-skill/`
- **Audit Logging**: Structured JSONL logs (mandatory for auto/envelope_only)
- **Organization Policy**: Enterprise override via `~/.snowflake/cortex/claude-skill-policy.yaml`

## Fast Path for Repeat Queries

**Session state is cached — do not re-run initialization steps on every query.**

Skip the following steps if they've already run in the current session:
- `discover_cortex.py` — output cached to `~/.cache/cortex-skill/cortex-capabilities.json`
- `route_request.py` — for obvious Snowflake queries (user says "Snowflake", "Cortex", "databases", "warehouse", etc.), you can skip routing and go straight to execution
- `cortex connections list` — the active connection doesn't change within a session; reuse it
- Any `config.yaml` / org-policy inspection — `ConfigManager` handles this (see note above)

**Minimal flow for a follow-up Snowflake query** (after the first query in a session):
1. (If `approval_mode: prompt`) ask user for approval
2. Call `execute_cortex.py` with the enriched prompt and envelope
3. Return results

That's it. Three steps — no re-discovery, no re-routing, no config inspection.

## Session Initialization

When this skill is first loaded:

### Step 1: Discover Cortex Capabilities
```bash
PYTHON=$(command -v python3 2>/dev/null || command -v python 2>/dev/null || echo python3)
$PYTHON scripts/discover_cortex.py
```

This script:
1. Runs `cortex skill list` to enumerate all available Cortex skills
2. Reads each skill's SKILL.md frontmatter and trigger patterns
3. Caches capabilities in `/tmp/cortex-capabilities.json` for this session
4. Returns structured data about what Cortex can handle

Expected output: JSON mapping of skill names to their trigger patterns and capabilities.

### Step 2: Load Routing Context
The discovered capabilities are loaded into memory to inform routing decisions throughout the session.

## Workflow: Handling User Requests

### Step 1: Analyze Request with LLM-Based Routing

Before taking any action, analyze the user's request:

```bash
PYTHON=$(command -v python3 2>/dev/null || command -v python 2>/dev/null || echo python3)
$PYTHON scripts/route_request.py --prompt "USER_PROMPT_HERE"
```

This script:
1. Loads Cortex capabilities from cache
2. Uses LLM reasoning to classify the request
3. Returns routing decision with confidence score

**Routing Logic**:
- **Route to Cortex** if request involves:
  - Snowflake databases, warehouses, schemas, tables
  - SQL queries specifically for Snowflake
  - Cortex AI features (Cortex Search, Cortex Analyst, ML functions)
  - Snowpark, dynamic tables, streams, tasks
  - Data governance, data quality, or security in Snowflake context
  - User explicitly mentions "Cortex" or "Snowflake"

- **Route to your coding agent** if request involves:
  - Local file operations (reading, writing, editing local files)
  - General programming (Python, JavaScript, etc. not Snowflake-specific)
  - Non-Snowflake databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)
  - Web development, frontend work
  - Infrastructure/DevOps unrelated to Snowflake
  - Git operations, GitHub, version control

### Step 2: Execute Based on Routing Decision

#### If routing is `coding_agent` (handle locally):
Handle the request directly using your agent's built-in capabilities. No Cortex involvement.

#### If routed to Cortex Code:
Proceed to Step 3.

### Step 3: Choose Security Envelope and Handle Approval

Before executing Cortex, the security wrapper handles approval based on configured mode.

#### Step 3a: Check Approval Mode

`security_wrapper.py` reads `approval_mode` from `config.yaml` internally — **do not inspect the config file yourself.** If `config.yaml` doesn't exist, the default is `prompt` mode.

- **prompt mode** (default): Requires user approval
- **auto mode**: Auto-approve with audit logging
- **envelope_only mode**: Auto-approve, no tool prediction

#### Step 3b: Handle Approval (if prompt mode)

If using prompt mode:

```bash
PYTHON=$(command -v python3 2>/dev/null || command -v python 2>/dev/null || echo python3)
$PYTHON scripts/security_wrapper.py \
  --prompt "ENRICHED_PROMPT" \
  --envelope "RW"
```

This will:
1. Predict required tools using LLM
2. Display approval prompt to user:
   ```
   Cortex Code needs to execute the following tools:
   
     • snowflake_sql_execute
     • Read
     • Write
   
   Envelope: RW
   Confidence: 85%
   
   Approve execution? [yes/no]
   ```
3. If approved, proceed to Step 3c
4. If denied, abort execution

#### Step 3c: Determine Security Envelope

Determine the appropriate security envelope based on the operation:
- **RO** (Read-Only): For queries and read operations - blocks Edit, Write, destructive Bash
- **RW** (Read-Write): For data modifications - allows most operations, blocks destructive Bash
- **RESEARCH**: For exploratory work - read access plus web tools
- **DEPLOY**: For deployment operations - blocks destructive Bash commands
- **NONE**: Custom blocklist via --disallowed-tools

### Step 4: Enrich Context for Cortex

Build an enriched prompt that includes:

**Claude Conversation Context**:
- Last 2-3 relevant exchanges from current Claude session
- Any Snowflake-specific details already discussed

**Recent Cortex Session Context**:
```bash
PYTHON=$(command -v python3 2>/dev/null || command -v python 2>/dev/null || echo python3)
$PYTHON scripts/read_cortex_sessions.py --limit 3
```

This reads the most recent Cortex session files from `~/.local/share/cortex/sessions/` to understand what Cortex recently worked on.

**Enriched Prompt Format**:
```
# Context from Current Session
[Recent relevant conversation history]

# Recent Cortex Work
[Summary from recent Cortex sessions]

# User Request
[Original user prompt]
```

### Step 5: Execute Cortex Code Headlessly

```bash
PYTHON=$(command -v python3 2>/dev/null || command -v python 2>/dev/null || echo python3)
$PYTHON scripts/execute_cortex.py \
  --prompt "ENRICHED_PROMPT" \
  --connection "connection_name" \
  --envelope "RW" \
  --disallowed-tools "tool1" "tool2"
```

This script:
1. Invokes `cortex -p "prompt" --output-format stream-json`
2. Uses print mode for prompt delivery and stream JSON output for non-TTY parsing
3. Applies envelope-based security via `--disallowed-tools` blocklist for safety
4. Parses NDJSON event stream in real-time
5. Detects tool use events and execution results

**Key Insight**: The wrapper intentionally does not combine `-p` with `--input-format stream-json`. Cortex reserves `--input-format` for JSON stdin input; with closed stdin, that combination can emit only an init event and exit before processing the prompt.

**Security Envelopes**:
- **RO** (Read-Only): Blocks Edit, Write, destructive Bash commands
- **RW** (Read-Write): Blocks destructive operations like rm -rf, sudo
- **RESEARCH**: Read access plus web tools, blocks write operations
- **DEPLOY**: Deployment operations, blocks destructive Bash commands
- **NONE**: Custom blocklist via --disallowed-tools parameter

**Event Stream Handling**:
- `type: assistant` → Cortex's responses, display to user
- `type: tool_use` → Cortex is calling a tool
- `type: result` → Final outcome

### Step 6: Handle Permission Requests

With the security wrapper:
- **prompt mode**: User approves BEFORE execution (no mid-execution prompts)
- **auto/envelope_only modes**: Non-blocked tools are auto-approved in stream JSON mode

The security wrapper handles permission management through:
1. **Upfront approval** (prompt mode): User approves predicted tools before execution
2. **Audit logging** (auto/envelope_only): All operations logged to `audit.log` in the skill's install directory
3. **Envelope enforcement**: Tool blocklist still enforced via `--disallowed-tools`

### Step 7: Return Results to User

Format Cortex's output for the current session:
- Show SQL query results in readable format
- Display any generated artifacts
- Report success/failure status
- Provide relevant excerpts from Cortex's analysis

## Examples

### Example 1: Snowflake Query
**User says**: "Show me the top 10 customers by revenue in Snowflake"

**Routing**: → Cortex Code (Snowflake SQL query)

**Security Envelope**: RW (allows SQL execution)

**Cortex Action**:
1. Uses snowflake_sql_execute to run: `SELECT customer_name, SUM(revenue) as total FROM sales GROUP BY customer_name ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 10`
2. Returns formatted results

**Result**: Table displayed to user with top 10 customers.

### Example 2: Local File Operation
**User says**: "Read the config.json file in this directory"

**Routing**: → your coding agent (local file operation)

**Claude Action**: Uses Read tool directly, no Cortex involvement.

**Result**: File contents displayed.

### Example 3: Data Quality Check
**User says**: "Check data quality for the SALES_DATA table"

**Routing**: → Cortex Code (Snowflake data quality - matches Cortex's data-quality skill)

**Security Envelope**: RW (allows SQL execution for analysis)

**Cortex Action**:
1. Runs data quality checks using its data-quality skill
2. Analyzes schema, null rates, duplicates, etc.
3. Generates quality report

**Result**: Comprehensive data quality report with recommendations.

## Important Notes

### Security Wrapper

The skill uses a security wrapper that provides:
- **Approval modes**: prompt (default), auto, envelope_only
- **Prompt sanitization**: Automatic PII removal and injection detection
- **Credential blocking**: Prevents routing when credential paths detected
- **Audit logging**: Mandatory for auto/envelope_only modes
- **Tool prediction**: LLM predicts required tools for approval prompt

**Configuration**: `config.yaml` in the skill's install directory, or via organization policy

### Headless Execution with Auto-Approval

When using auto or envelope_only modes:
- All tool calls are automatically approved without interactive prompts
- Works for built-in tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob) and non-builtin tools (snowflake_sql_execute, data_diff, MCP tools)
- Uses print mode for prompt delivery and stream JSON mode for non-TTY output parsing
- Security is controlled via `--disallowed-tools` blocklist instead of interactive approval; use these modes only in trusted contexts

### Stateless Execution
Each Cortex invocation is stateless. Context must be explicitly provided via enriched prompts.

### Memory Boundaries
- **Your coding agent maintains**: Full conversation history, user preferences, project context
- **Cortex Code receives**: Only task-specific context for current operation
- **Cortex sessions are read**: For historical context enrichment only

### Security Envelope Strategy
Choose envelopes based on operation risk:
1. **Start with RO or RW**: Most operations fit here
2. **Use RESEARCH**: When web access is needed for exploratory work
3. **Use DEPLOY**: Only for deployment-style operations that require broader non-destructive tool access
4. **Use NONE with custom blocklist**: When fine-grained control is needed

### Performance Considerations
- Cortex skill discovery runs once per session (cached)
- Each Cortex execution adds ~2-5 seconds latency
- Use routing wisely to minimize unnecessary Cortex calls

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Cortex CLI not found"
**Cause**: Cortex Code is not installed or not in PATH

**Solution**:
```bash
which cortex
# If not found, check installation: ~/.snowflake/cortex/
```

### Error: Approval prompt not appearing (or appearing unexpectedly)
**Cause**: Approval mode misconfiguration or organization policy override

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check approval mode (path varies by agent: ~/.claude/, ~/.cursor/, ~/.codex/, etc.)
cat "$(dirname $(which cortex))/../skills/cortex-code/config.yaml" | grep approval_mode 2>/dev/null \
  || cat ~/skills/cortex-code/config.yaml | grep approval_mode

# Check organization policy (overrides user config)
cat ~/.snowflake/cortex/claude-skill-policy.yaml 2>/dev/null

# Expected:
#   prompt = shows approval prompts (default)
#   auto = auto-approves all operations
#   envelope_only = auto-approves, no tool prediction
```

### Error: "Prompt contains credential file path"
**Cause**: Prompt mentions paths matching credential allowlist (e.g., ~/.ssh/, .env)

**Solution**:
1. Remove credential references from prompt
2. Or customize allowlist in config.yaml if false positive

### Error: PII removed from prompts
**Symptom**: Emails, phone numbers replaced with placeholders

**Cause**: Automatic sanitization enabled by default

**Solution**: Disable if needed (not recommended):
```yaml
security:
  sanitize_conversation_history: false
```

### Error: "Permission denied" despite auto mode
**Cause**: Tool is in the --disallowed-tools blocklist for current envelope

**Solution**:
1. Check which envelope is being used (RO/RW/RESEARCH/DEPLOY)
2. If operation is safe, switch to a less restrictive envelope
3. Or use envelope="NONE" with custom --disallowed-tools list

### Error: Audit log not created
**Symptom**: No audit.log despite auto/envelope_only mode

**Solution**:
```bash
# Create the skill's install directory if missing and set permissions
# Path is agent-specific: ~/.claude/skills/cortex-code/, ~/.cursor/skills/cortex-code/, etc.
chmod 700 "$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/.." && pwd)"

# Verify audit_log_path in config.yaml within the skill directory
grep audit_log_path config.yaml
```

### Error: Tools still requiring approval
**Cause**: Approval mode, envelope blocklist, or stream JSON invocation is misconfigured

**Solution**: Ensure the wrapper invokes `cortex -p "..." --output-format stream-json` without `--input-format`, and that the configured envelope does not block the intended tool.

### Issue: Routing sends Snowflake query to your coding agent
**Cause**: Routing logic didn't detect Snowflake keywords

**Solution**:
1. Check if user mentioned "Snowflake" explicitly
2. Review routing script logic in `scripts/route_request.py`
3. Add more trigger patterns to routing context

### Issue: Cortex returns "Connection refused"
**Cause**: Snowflake connection not configured in Cortex

**Solution**:
```bash
cortex connections list
# Verify connection is active
# Check ~/.snowflake/cortex/settings.json for cortexAgentConnectionName
```

### Issue: Context enrichment too large
**Cause**: Including too much conversation history

**Solution**: Limit to last 2-3 relevant exchanges, summarize older context.

## Advanced: Custom Routing Rules

To customize routing beyond default logic, edit `scripts/route_request.py`:

```python
# Add custom patterns
FORCE_CORTEX_PATTERNS = [
    "snowflake",
    "cortex",
    "warehouse",
    "snowpark"
]

FORCE_CLAUDE_PATTERNS = [
    "local file",
    "git commit",
    "python script" # unless Snowpark
]
```
