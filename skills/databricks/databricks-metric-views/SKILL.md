# Unity Catalog Metric Views

Define reusable, governed business metrics in YAML that separate measure definitions from dimension groupings for flexible querying.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Defining **standardized business metrics** (revenue, order counts, conversion rates)
- Building **KPI layers** shared across dashboards, Genie, and SQL queries
- Creating metrics with **complex aggregations** (ratios, distinct counts, filtered measures)
- Defining **window measures** (moving averages, running totals, period-over-period, YTD)
- Modeling **star or snowflake schemas** with joins in metric definitions
- Enabling **materialization** for pre-computed metric aggregations

## Prerequisites

- **Databricks Runtime 17.2+** (for YAML version 1.1)
- SQL warehouse with `CAN USE` permissions
- `SELECT` on source tables, `CREATE TABLE` + `USE SCHEMA` in the target schema


## When to load which sub-doc

| Sub-doc | Use when |
|---|---|
| [references/quickstart-mcp-yaml.md](references/quickstart-mcp-yaml.md) | Metric Views — Quick Start, MCP Tools, YAML Spec Quick Reference |

## Key Concepts

### Dimensions vs Measures

| | Dimensions | Measures |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Categorize and group data | Aggregate numeric values |
| **Examples** | Region, Date, Status | SUM(revenue), COUNT(orders) |
| **In queries** | Used in SELECT and GROUP BY | Wrapped in `MEASURE()` |
| **SQL expressions** | Any SQL expression | Must use aggregate functions |

### Why Metric Views vs Standard Views?

| Feature | Standard Views | Metric Views |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Aggregation locked at creation | Yes | No - flexible at query time |
| Safe re-aggregation of ratios | No | Yes |
| Star/snowflake schema joins | Manual | Declarative in YAML |
| Materialization | Separate MV needed | Built-in |
| AI/BI Genie integration | Limited | Native |

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **SELECT * not supported** | Must explicitly list dimensions and use MEASURE() for measures |
| **"Cannot resolve column"** | Dimension/measure names with spaces need backtick quoting |
| **JOIN at query time fails** | Joins must be in the YAML definition, not in the SELECT query |
| **MEASURE() required** | All measure references must be wrapped: `MEASURE(\`name\`)` |
| **DBR version error** | Requires Runtime 17.2+ for YAML v1.1, or 16.4+ for v0.1 |
| **Materialization not working** | Requires serverless compute enabled; currently experimental |

## Integrations

Metric views work natively with:
- **AI/BI Dashboards** - Use as datasets for visualizations
- **AI/BI Genie** - Natural language querying of metrics
- **Alerts** - Set threshold-based alerts on measures
- **SQL Editor** - Direct SQL querying with MEASURE()
- **Catalog Explorer UI** - Visual creation and browsing
